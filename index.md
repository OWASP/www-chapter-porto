## Welcome to OWASP Porto (Portugal) Chapter 
The OWASP Porto Chapter is run by [Paulo Batalhao](mailto:paulo.batalhao@owasp.org) and [Nelson Pereira](mailto:nelson.pereira@owasp.org).

We are a bunch of friendly people interested in Application Security, and as Software is all over these days, means we
are interested in every flavour of security.

Our main goal is to promote the software security and provide local knowledge in Portuguese and English.

## Participation
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters Policy](/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. 

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our [Projects](/projects/), [Local Chapters](/chapters/), [Events](/events/), [Online Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){:target='_blank'}, and [Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/){:target='_blank'}. We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert. We also encourage you to be [become a member](/membership/) or consider a [donation](/donate/) to support our ongoing work.
