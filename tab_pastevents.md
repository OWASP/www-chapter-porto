> ### Do not Live in the Shadows (APIs)
> **Speaker: Teresa Pereira**
>
>Shadow APIs — undocumented, unmanaged, or hidden APIs within an organization’s ecosystem — pose a significant risk to security, compliance, and operational resilience. These APIs often emerge due to rapid development cycles, decentralized practices, or legacy systems, creating critical blind spots for development and security teams.
>This talk explores the concept of Shadow APIs, starting with a clear definition and their origins, and examines the multifaceted risks they introduce to software development. Through real-world examples, we will highlight the potential consequences of ignoring these “hidden doors” and discuss strategies for their identification, management, and mitigation. By the end of this session, you will gain actionable insights and strategies to reduce the risks posed by Shadow APIs and build more resilient, secure, and compliant systems.

>**Bio**
>I’m currently working as a Cyber Threat Hunter at Siemens Energy. Before this, I worked as a Pentester at KPMG Portugal for nearly three years. My journey into API Security began in 2022, and by 2023, I was speaking at apidays Paris. In 2024, I was a speaker at apidays London and apidays Paris.

### Talks

> ### Hacking Embedded Devices - From Black Box to UID 0
> **Speaker: Zezadas and David Silva**
>
> Prepare to bend the rules of time and uncover the secrets of an embedded device in a way that even the most adventurous time traveler wouldn’t even dream to explore. In this enlightening presentation, Zezadas, a security researcher, leads you through the remarkable process of gaining root access in an unsuspecting video converter embedded device. Witness the fusion of expertise and creative problem-solving as Zezadas shares a step-by-step account of their exploits. Discover firsthand that hacking embedded devices, often perceived as daunting, can be accessible, enjoyable, and, most importantly, a journey through time. Whether you’re a security aficionado or simply curious about the intersection of technology and time-travel, this talk promises to entertain, educate, and inspire.

> ### Lessons Learned and How Not to Choose Your Next Drive
> **Speaker: Paulo Silva** 
>
>Don't worry, we can (also) hear your thoughts—"No, the car manufacturers' security talk again. No!" But fear not, this time we're shifting gears. Instead of focusing on cars, we'll use lessons from our research to highlight security pitfalls that plague organizations across industries. From cloud bucket misconfigurations to BOLA bugs giving users more power than a valet with your Ferrari keys, we'll share real-world lessons learned, laugh at the chaos, and discuss how to avoid these traps. Anyway, those fancy PoCs may strike again: the best way to prove impact and get rid of annoying web flaws. Buckle up—it’s a wild ride!

## #5 The Farmer: July 2nd, 2025 @ Ordem dos Engenheiros - Região Norte (OERN).

We are excited to bring you another

### Agenda

**18:00** - Intro and Welcome by the OWASP Porto chapter leadership \
**18:15** - Applying Threat Modelling in modern development environments by Gonçalo Matias \
**19:00** - Jedi^WGenAI Mind Tricks - Are these the secure chatbots you’re looking for? by Bruno Morisson \
**19:45** - Drinks & Dinner by OERN. \


### Talks

> ### Applying Threat Modelling in modern development environments
> **Speaker: Gonçalo Matias**
>
> In today’s fast-paced software development, understanding and mitigating security risk is paramount. Adopting security activities early in the software development lifecycle is crucial for the efficient management of resources and for controlling development costs. Threat modelling stands out as one of the most impactful ways to “shift left”.
> This session will leverage the fact that every person is already consistently applying some form of threat modeling in their day-to-day activities, and expand that existing capability into a more structured skill. We will explore various approaches, including how Ocado Technology applies its own methodology to threat modeling.
> Whether developing simple plugins or large-scale systems, securing serverless apps or complex microservice architectures, working within agile sprints or traditional waterfall methodologies, this session will equip participants with strategies for analyzing the risk profile of an app and applying threat modeling processes suitable to that profile.
>
> **Bio**
> **Gonçalo Matias** is a Senior Application Security Engineer at Ocado Technology, bringing over 20 years of software development experience across diverse platforms, languages, and frameworks. A security enthusiast since his earliest projects, his career evolved from software development to specialised security roles, including research and penetration testing. Gonçalo is deeply interested in the interplay between security and business objectives, with threat modelling as his favorite security activity. He plays electric guitar and is an instructor of "Haidong Gumdo", a Korean sword martial art.

> ### Jedi^MGenAI Mind Tricks - Are these the secure chatbots you’re looking for?
> **Speaker: Bruno Morisson**
>
>After experimenting with various public challenges on LLM chatbots—like Gandalf, PromptAirlines, and more—I decided to build my own. Not just to understand how LLMs work, but to see how easily I could break them.
>In this talk, I’ll dive into the security risks of Generative AI, particularly LLM chatbots, and explore vulnerabilities that are often overlooked. From sensitive information disclosure to prompt injections and jailbreaking, I’ll walk you through real-world examples that demonstrate just how these systems can be manipulated. No tinfoil hat required.
