### Talks:

> ### The Security of Large Language Models
> Large Language Models (LLMs) received a lot of attention recently and it is possible to find them integrated into various applications, from well-known chat applications to content creation, search, translation and much more. We will overview LLMs and delve into some details to better understand known attacks.

> #### Nuno Pereira
> Nuno Pereira taught cybersecurity-related topics for more than 15 years.

> ### SBOM, SBOM, you're an SBOM
> Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a concept that recently has been making waves in SDLC spaces but it isn't entirely new. Most mature languages have a (sometimes) mature package management system, either built-in (e.g., Rust's cargo) or de facto (e.g., Maven) that allows developers to define dependencies, resolve conflicts and do composition analysis.
> SBOMs, however, allow you to take this one step further, making it language-agnostic and allowing components from different ecosystems to use a common language for comparisons and analysis. However, we don't get those features out of the box. For example, consider common libraries in different package repositories - are all OpenSSL packages created equally and equivalent?
> OWASP is playing a part in this via its support for projects like CycloneDX which aims to provide a full-stack BOM standard to cover specific scopes such as the CBOM (Cryptography) and HBOM (Hardware) among others.
> This shift towards software being more transparent and traceable is not without its detractors, as entire business models are predicated on customers using purely opaque boxes.
> In the spirit of the topic, here is a Talk Bill of Topics:
> - Are BOM requirements burdensome?
> - Are we revealing too much of the "secret sauce"?
> - Does having an SBOM instantly make a piece of software more secure?
> - If we take a piece of software and replace every entry in its BOM with fully equivalent packages, one by one, is it still the same software in the end?
> This talk targets a beginner to intermediate audience and will provide an overview of (S)BOMs, their ongoing challenges, and what they can bring to the table in terms of security. 

> #### Diogo Sousa
> An opinionated individual with an interest in cryptography and its intersection with secure software development.
