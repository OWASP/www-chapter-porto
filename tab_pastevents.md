### Videos
[The Security of Large Language Models by Nuno Pereira](https://youtu.be/hZcDXGJviFQ)

[SBOM, SBOM, you’re an SBOM by Diogo Sousa](https://youtu.be/ApmWkGwd2Mw)

### Agenda:
 **18:00** - Intro and Welcome by the OWASP Porto chapter leadership \
 **18:15** - The Security of Large Language Models by Nuno Pereira \
 **19:10** - SBOM, SBOM, you're an SBOM by Diogo Sousa \
 **20:00** - Drinks & Dinner by Boost IT 

### Talks:

> ### The Security of Large Language Models
> Large Language Models (LLMs) received a lot of attention recently and it is possible to find them integrated into various applications, from well-known chat applications to content creation, search, translation and much more. We will overview LLMs and delve into some details to better understand known attacks.

> #### Nuno Pereira
> Nuno Pereira taught cybersecurity-related topics for more than 15 years.

> ### SBOM, SBOM, you're an SBOM
> Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a concept that recently has been making waves in SDLC spaces but it isn't entirely new. Most mature languages have a (sometimes) mature package management system, either built-in (e.g., Rust's cargo) or de facto (e.g., Maven) that allows developers to define dependencies, resolve conflicts and do composition analysis.
> SBOMs, however, allow you to take this one step further, making it language-agnostic and allowing components from different ecosystems to use a common language for comparisons and analysis. However, we don't get those features out of the box. For example, consider common libraries in different package repositories - are all OpenSSL packages created equally and equivalent?
> OWASP is playing a part in this via its support for projects like CycloneDX which aims to provide a full-stack BOM standard to cover specific scopes such as the CBOM (Cryptography) and HBOM (Hardware) among others.
> This shift towards software being more transparent and traceable is not without its detractors, as entire business models are predicated on customers using purely opaque boxes.
> In the spirit of the topic, here is a Talk Bill of Topics:
> - Are BOM requirements burdensome?
> - Are we revealing too much of the "secret sauce"?
> - Does having an SBOM instantly make a piece of software more secure?
> - If we take a piece of software and replace every entry in its BOM with fully equivalent packages, one by one, is it still the same software in the end?
> This talk targets a beginner to intermediate audience and will provide an overview of (S)BOMs, their ongoing challenges, and what they can bring to the table in terms of security. 

> #### Diogo Sousa
> An opinionated individual with an interest in cryptography and its intersection with secure software development.

### Talks:

> ### From Theory to Practice: Navigating the Challenges of Vulnerability Research

Abstract:
>Transitioning from theoretical knowledge to the practical aspect in web security often presents some extra challenges. Real-world scenarios introduce complexities such as bad character filters and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), demanding the researcher to investigate some way to bypass these restrictions. Here are some of our learnings: 1) Drawing from collaborative efforts and senior industry research becomes pivotal. 2) Embracing failure as a learning experience is fundamental. 3) Learn a bit about how ethical security research faces legal hurdles in countries like Portugal, hindering progress and discouraging potential researchers. Navigating this bridge from theory to practice in web security requires technical prowess and resilience, and I hope to share some of my learnings from this journey with you in this talk.

> ### Raphael Silva
> I’m Raphael Silva, an AppSec Analyst at Checkmarx. I've participated in public speaking and public-facing activities, notably a Code Review workshop at AppSec Village at DEFCON30 and talks about AI and AppSec at my former university. I’ve found multiple vulnerabilities in open-source products over the years. I’m always looking for ways to expand my knowledge in the field, be that sharpening my technical skills by reading innovative research, practicing in CTFs, engaging in some bug bounty hunting, and taking certifications. I'm eWPTXv2 certified and currently enrolled in OSCP.

>### Harnessing Reachability Analysis to Discern Real Threats in Software Dependencies
> In this talk, we will dive into the shortcomings of traditional dependency analysis methods, which usually focus on building manifests and metadata, to spot security or performance vulnerabilities in Java projects. While tools like Maven Dependency Checker and Gradle's dependency-analysis plugin are invaluable for managing dependencies, they often fall short when we need quick and precise answers, forcing developers to lean on time-consuming tests and manual code reviews. We believe that a thorough look at how dependencies are actually used in the code—with the help of static and reachability analyses—can be a more effective way to pinpoint real threats in Java dependencies.
> Our goal is to provide attendees with practical strategies for using static and reachability analyses, promoting a more detailed method for managing dependencies and finding vulnerabilities in software applications.

> ### Joseph Hejderup
> Part-time developer, part-time PhD student, and full-time enthusiast in developing and researching techniques that make package management systems more intelligent and resilient against supply chain problems! Joseph Hejderup (Researcher/Software Engineer at Endor Labs & PhD student at Delft University of Technology) is applying program analysis techniques to understand better how we use third-party components and what risks third-party components entail from a security and maintenance perspective.
